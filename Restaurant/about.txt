The Real Jerk is a cultural icon that burst on to the Toronto food scene in 1984.Most new customers are awestruck by the decor which is inspired by beach restaurants in Jamaica, Trinidad, or Cuba.The restaurant has been at its current location for 24 years and features a dramatic facade that draws you in and gets you hooked on the signature Jerk seasoning dishes.  As they say at the Real Jerk "we don't just sell food, we celebrate Caribbean culture"Ed and Lilly Pottinger brought their uniquely Caribbean cuisine and widely popular decor to Queen Street East.  It has been a mainstay ever since.If your having a special occasion or simply need wholesome comfort food on a cold winter day, the Real Jerk is the place to be. This 80 seat restaurant is also available for theme parties, movie shoots, and catering special events. To make a reservation call us at 416 463-6055.Come and experience what tens of thousands of Torontonians and tourists have already enjoyed over the years.Everything will be irie....
